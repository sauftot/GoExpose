# GoExpose
Simple reverse proxy to expose a IPv4 application server behind uncontrollable NAT to the internet.<br>
It consists of 2 applications, one running on your local server and one running on a rented VPS or any other node exposed and routable through the internet.<br><br>
RPserver and RPclient are both rewritten but untested.

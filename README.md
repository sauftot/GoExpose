# GoExpose
Simple reverse proxy to expose a TCP application server behind uncontrollable NAT to the internet.<br>
It consists of 2 applications, one running on your local server and one running on a cheap, rented VPS or any other node exposed and routable from the internet.<br><br>
RPserver and RPclient are both tested on ubuntu 22.04 with minecraft as the exposed application server.
